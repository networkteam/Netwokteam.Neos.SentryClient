Networkteam.Neos.SentryClient
=============================

This is a Sentry client package for the Neos CMS (https://www.neos.io).

It's based on https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php.

Have a look at https://sentry.io for more information about Sentry.

Compatibility:
--------------

| Neos CMS | Plugin Version  |
| -------- | --------------- |
| >= 9.0   | 5.x             |
| >= 4.0   | 4.x             |

Installation:
-------------

    $ composer require networkteam/neos-sentryclient

Configuration:
--------------

Add the following to your `Settings.yaml` and replace the `dsn` setting with your project DSN (API Keys in your Sentry project):

    Networkteam:
      SentryClient:
        # The Sentry DSN
        dsn: 'http://public_key:secret_key@your-sentry-server.com/project-id'

You can implement the `\Networkteam\SentryClient\User\UserContextServiceInterface` to pass your own user context 
information to the logging. If you do not have the TYPO3.Party Package and don't want to implement your own 
`UserContextService` you need to set the `\Networkteam\SentryClient\User\DummyUserContext` in the Objects.yaml like

    Networkteam\SentryClient\User\UserContextServiceInterface:
      className: Networkteam\SentryClient\User\DummyUserContext

This will prevent any collection of user information except information that is available via the Flow SecurityContext.

Usage:
------

Sentry will log all exceptions that have the rendering option `logException` enabled. This can be enabled or disabled
by status code or exception class according to the Flow configuration.

------------
